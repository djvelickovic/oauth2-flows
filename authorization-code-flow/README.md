# Authorization Code Flow

```
The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access
tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients.
Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
from the authorization server.

## Notes

- Optimized for **confidential** clients
- Usually used in traditional web apps with session
- Access token is not exposed publicly, it's stored in the session instead
